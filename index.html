        <h3 class="text-left">10 Steve Jobs quotes that will inspire you to make your dreams a reality:</h3>

        <blockquote><q>Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>My favorite things in life don’t cost any money. It’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you truly want to become.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>That’s been one of my mantras—focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex; you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>Things don’t have to change the world to be important.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.</q>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote><q>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.</q>
        </blockquote>
